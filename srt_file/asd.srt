1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Everything that you thought had meaning, every hope, dream, or moment of happiness.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
None of it matters as you lie bleeding out on the battlefield.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
None of it changes what a speeding rock does to a body. We all die.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But does that mean our lives are meaningless?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Does that mean that there was no point in our being born?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Would you say that of our slain comrades? What about their lives?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Were they meaningless?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
They were not. Their men resurfaced as an example to us all.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The courageous fallen, the anguished fallen. Their lives have meaning because we, the living, refused to forget them.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And as we ride to certain death, we trust our successes to do the same for us.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Because my soldiers do not buckle or yield when faced with the cruelty of this world.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
My soldiers push forward. My soldiers scream out. My soldiers rage!
